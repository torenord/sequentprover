# Sequent Prover

This repository contains files that parse the input format of Problem 3 of [Oblig 1](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF3170/h16/undervisningsmateriale/oblig1.pdf) in the course INF3170/INF4171. It may be used as a starting point to solve the problem.

Currently, the program only prints the parsed formula. Your job is to write a program that prints to the screen whether the formula given to standard in is valid or not.

You may solve the problem with any language, but the program needs to have behaviour similar to this:

```
$ ./yoursolver < input.txt
Valid
```

Or:

```
$ ./yoursolver < input.txt
Not valid
```
